              <p class="about__description">Legends say The Snow Shogun was behind the assault and escape from Earth, helping all penguins seek refuge and safety from mankind and its human grasp was when they found solitude on The CubeVerse Meta Planet. These penguins became a legend for generations to come !!!!!!!!
              </p>

              <p class="about__description">The Shogun accompanied by The Legendary Percys protected and served all penguins.</p>

              <p class="about__description">They came across a chilly ðŸ¥¶ Metaverse called The SNOWZONE</p>

              <p class="about__description">Upon building their community, they stumbled across A ROCK , as bright as the sun and twice as colorful as a rainbow, this Meta Rock was special beyond anyone's imagination!</p>

              <p class="about__description">The rock later came to be called The Song Stone. Penguins gathered in mass numbers singing in harmony, one by one all gaining energy and powers from this mysterious stone.</p>

              <p class="about__description">Then one pair of penguins took the leap like no other had before and used The Song Stone to mate,</p>

              <p class="about__description">Poppys started producing eggs, the likes the penguins had never seen, as breeding using The Song Stone created Prehistoric Meta Snow Eggs!</p>

              <p class="about__description">Breeding With The Song Stone From The Ground Of The CubeVerse Planet Created A Prehistoric Meta Snow EGG !!</p>

              <p class="about__description">Then a 3rd type of penguin was born.</p>
